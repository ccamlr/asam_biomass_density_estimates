# Krill biomass density estimates from the ASAM-2021 Metadata table

This repository contains Rmarkdown scripts to analyze the biomass density estimates from the ASAM-2021 metadata table.

The underlying data for these scripts are available in the egroup https://groups.ccamlr.org/node/522.

At the moment there are two scripts, built to address priority work indentified during WG-ASAM-2021:

*2.16 The Working Group agreed to summarise the acoustic survey biomass estimates from the updated table of metadata collated during WG-ASAM-2021 (also see paragraph 2.12) in an intersessional e-group, and undertook to provide advice on biomass and krill density estimates to  WG-EMM-2021  at  the subarea  and  any  other  appropriate  spatial  scales,  with  preliminary  results  on  estimates  of  uncertainty  provided  to  WG-SAM-2021  to  assist  with  generalised  R  yield  model  (Grym)  projections. A  draft  template  developed  by  the  Working  Group  for  the  summary of estimates is shown in Table 1.*

- The script _asam2020Var.Rmd_ is focused on uncertainty estimates.

- The script _ASAM_2021_KrillBiomassStats.Rmd_ is focused on mean estimates.
